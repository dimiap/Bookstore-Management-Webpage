Bookstore Management with ASP.NET (MVC)


A bookstore chain uses the following Access Database to organize its data. 
As part of its IT upgrade, a web application is needed to improve its data entry and management efficiency.
I developed a web application in Visual C# (ASP.NET Web Application) using MVC in Visual Studio. First of all, we execute instpubs.sql file
that is in the repository, we execute it in SQL Server Management Studio.
The application can insert,delete or edit the data in the database. Also the app can search the authors whose books are best sellers and
it can show the orders of a book. We can also backup and restore the database.
